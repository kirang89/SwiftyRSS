# SwiftyRSS

A simplistic RSS reader written mainly for education. (WIP)

## Motivation

I wrote this app mainly to:

- Get my feet wet in Swift
- Consider whether to use [Realm]() as a replacement for Core-Data in future projects.

While doing so, I may have gotten carried away with mucking around the views
trying to make it not look like shit :D

## Installing Dependencies

``` sh
pod install

# Open SwiftyRSS.xcworkspace in Xcode
```

## License

You may use the code as you wish.
